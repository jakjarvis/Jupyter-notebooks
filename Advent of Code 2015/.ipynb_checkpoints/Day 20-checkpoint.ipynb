    "- The second Elf (number 2) delivers presents to every second house: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ....\n",

    "- House 9 got 130 presents.\n",

    "The first house gets 10 presents: it is visited only by Elf 1, which delivers 1 * 10 = 10 presents. The fourth house gets 70 presents, because it is visited by Elves 1, 2, and 4, for a total of 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 presents.\n",
